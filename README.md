## 🚀 Function

- We designed this with reference to Google Material Design. And developed the app in 100% Kotlin language. 

- Unlike the current volunteering web page, Similarities between words through word embedding techniques in Python's Word2Vec module were obtained, so that there were no missing results when running search services. 

- We wanted to provide customized service activity information to individual users through filtering algorithms.
- can use the Retrofit2 Library to communicate data in both directions with the Django server
- preparing administrator web page.
